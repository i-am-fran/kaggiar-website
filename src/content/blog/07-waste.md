Garbage disposal on the island is differentiated (recycled) and _mandatory_. Please:

- Separate your waste into plastic, glass, paper, organic, and general trash.
- Dispose of bags in the designated bins along the main road.
- Never leave garbage outside the house or bins.
- Always secure the bin lids (to keep cats and dogs out).
