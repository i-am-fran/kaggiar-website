**Check-out time is 10:00 AM**  

Before you leave, we kindly ask you to:

- Leave the house neat and clean. We don’t charge a high cleaning fee, so we rely on your care.
- Remove all trash and food from the house and refrigerator.
- Dispose of garbage properly in the recycling bins located on the main road.
- Make sure to close the bin lids and, if possible, place a stone on top to prevent animals from rummaging through the waste.
- Turn off all lights, fans, and air conditioning.
- Return the keys to the same lockbox.
