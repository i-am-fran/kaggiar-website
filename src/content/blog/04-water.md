Water is a precious resource on the island. The dammuso is not connected to the water mains—rainwater is collected during the winter and stored in tanks.

Please:

- Use water sparingly, especially for showers and washing dishes.
- Turn off taps when brushing teeth or soaping.
- Report any leaks or issues immediately.
