The dammuso is located in the Cala 5 Denti area.  
Please get the precise location on [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/place/36°49'11.7%22N+11°59'58.8%22E/@36.819925,11.9970811,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m4!3m3!8m2!3d36.819925!4d11.999656?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDYwMS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) or set your GPS to: `36°49'11.7"N 11°59'58.8"E`

## Once you arrive

- You will see a stone road that climbs inland from the parking area.
- Follow the road uphill until you reach a fork—stay left, toward the valley side.
- At the end of the road, you’ll arrive at a private parking area shaded by trees.
- You may park anywhere, as there are no assigned spots. Just ensure you leave enough space for another car.
- From the parking area, a ramp leads down to the garden and the house.
- You’ll recognize the property from the photos you received.

### Note

The road to the house is unpaved, but only for a very short stretch, so please drive carefully.

A Fiat Panda or similar small vehicle is ideal for navigating the island’s terrain
